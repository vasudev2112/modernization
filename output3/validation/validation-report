# Logic Validation Report

## 1. Structural Comparison

- Class Match:
  - Both Java and Python have a single class named DiscountCalculator.
- Method Match:
  - Java: static double calculateDiscount(double, String)
  - Python: staticmethod calculate_discount(float, str)
  - Method names use different conventions but are structurally equivalent.
- Parameter Match:
  - Both methods accept two parameters: amount (double/float), customerType/customer_type (String/str).
- Entry Point Match:
  - Java: public static void main(String[] args)
  - Python: if __name__ == "__main__": block
  - Entry points are equivalent for sample execution.

## 2. Logical Comparison

- Conditional Logic:
  - Customer type is compared case-insensitively in both implementations (Java uses equalsIgnoreCase, Python uses lower()).
  - "PREMIUM" yields 20% discount, "STANDARD" yields 10%, otherwise 0% in both.
  - If amount > 10000, an additional 5% discount is added in both.
- Arithmetic Operations:
  - Discount is calculated as amount - (amount * discount) in both.
- Edge Case Handling:
  - If final amount < 0, set to 0 in both implementations.
- Return Behavior:
  - Both return the final amount as a floating point value.
