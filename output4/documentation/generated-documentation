## 1. File Overview

- File Name: discount_calculator.py
- Language: Python
- Location: Not specified (converted from Java input)

## 2. Imports

- No import statements found in this file.

## 3. Classes

### Class: DiscountCalculator

#### Methods

- Method Name: calculate_discount

  - Parameters:
    - amount (float): original purchase amount
    - customer_type (str): type of customer (PREMIUM or STANDARD)
  - Return Type: float (final amount after discount)
  - Description: Calculates the final amount after applying discounts based on customer type and purchase amount. Customer type can be "PREMIUM" or "STANDARD". An additional discount is applied for amounts greater than 10,000. Ensures the final amount is not negative.

- Entry Point: The Python equivalent of Java's main method is provided using `if __name__ == "__main__":`. It calls `calculate_discount` with sample values and prints the results.

## 4. Exception Handling

- No explicit exception handling (try-except blocks) is present in this file.

## 5. Execution Flow

- The main block serves as the entry point. It invokes `calculate_discount` with three sets of parameters and prints the resulting discounted amounts to standard output.

## 6. Observations

- The class contains only a static method.
- The sample execution in the main block demonstrates usage with different customer types and purchase amounts.
- Discount logic is based on customer type and purchase amount thresholds.
- No external dependencies or libraries are used.

## 7. Static Analysis Limitations

- No explicit description provided in source code.
- Behavior not determinable from static code analysis: The actual runtime input/output, integration with other systems, or business context beyond the code comments and structure cannot be inferred.
