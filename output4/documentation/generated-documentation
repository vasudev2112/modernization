1. File Overview

- File Name: discount_calculator.py
- Language: Python 3.9+
- Location: input/discount_calculator.py

2. Imports

- No explicit import statements present in this file.

3. Classes

Class: DiscountCalculator

Methods

Method Name: calculate_discount

  - Parameters:
    - amount (float): original purchase amount
    - customer_type (str): type of customer ("PREMIUM" or "STANDARD")
  - Return Type: float (final amount after discount)
  - Description: Calculates the final amount after applying discounts based on customer type and purchase amount. PREMIUM customers receive a 20% discount, STANDARD customers receive a 10% discount. An additional 5% discount is applied if the purchase amount exceeds 10,000. The final amount is never negative.

Method Name: __main__ execution block

  - Parameters: None (uses hardcoded sample values)
  - Return Type: None (prints results to standard output)
  - Description: Entry point of the program. Demonstrates usage of the calculate_discount method with sample values and prints the results.

4. Exception Handling

- No explicit exception handling (try-except blocks) present in the code.

5. Execution Flow

- The main execution block calls DiscountCalculator.calculate_discount with three sample arguments and prints the resulting discounted amounts.

6. Observations

- The file contains a single class, DiscountCalculator, with one static method.
- Method calculate_discount uses conditional logic to determine discount rates.
- No comments or docstrings are present in the Python code.
- The code does not import or rely on external libraries.
- The main execution block provides sample output for validation.

7. Static Analysis Limitations

- Behavior not determinable from static code analysis: The actual runtime output, possible integration points, and business context are not inferable from the code alone.
- No information available about the broader application or usage outside this file.
- Only visible code elements are documented; no assumptions are made about hidden dependencies or architectural intent.
- No explicit description provided in source code.
