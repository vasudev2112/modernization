# Code Documentation

## 1. File Overview

- File Name: discount_calculator.py

- Language: Python

- Location: Not specified

## 2. Imports

None.

## 3. Classes

### Class: DiscountCalculator

#### Methods

- Method Name: calculate_discount

  - Parameters:
    - amount (float): original purchase amount
    - customer_type (str): type of customer ("PREMIUM" or "STANDARD")

  - Return Type: float

  - Description: Calculates the final amount after applying discounts based on customer type and purchase amount. Returns the final amount after discount, ensuring it is not negative.

- Method Name: (main block)

  - Parameters:
    - None (uses hardcoded sample values)

  - Return Type: None

  - Description: Entry point for sample execution. Prints the results of the calculate_discount method for sample inputs.

## 4. Exception Handling

No explicit exception handling present in the code.

## 5. Execution Flow

- The main block executes three calls to DiscountCalculator.calculate_discount with different parameters and prints the results.
- The calculate_discount method applies a discount based on customer type and purchase amount, ensures the result is not negative, and returns the final amount.

## 6. Observations

- The code uses hard-coded discount rates for "PREMIUM" (20%) and "STANDARD" (10%) customers.
- An additional 5% discount is applied for amounts greater than 10,000.
- If the customer type is not recognized, no discount is applied.
- The final amount is never negative due to a post-calculation check.
- No explicit description provided in source code.

## 7. Static Analysis Limitations

- Behavior not determinable from static code analysis: The business purpose of the discount calculation, the meaning of customer types, and integration with other systems cannot be inferred.
- No information about external dependencies or frameworks is present.
- No runtime assumptions or deployment information included.
