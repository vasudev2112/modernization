# Logic Validation Report

## 1. Structural Comparison

- Class Match:
  Both Java and Python files define a single class named DiscountCalculator.

- Method Match:
  Java: calculateDiscount (static)
  Python: calculate_discount (staticmethod)
  Both files contain one main logic method for discount calculation.

- Parameter Match:
  Java: double amount, String customerType
  Python: float amount, str customer_type
  Parameter count and order are equivalent.

- Entry Point Match:
  Java: main method present with sample executions.
  Python: No explicit entry point (__main__) detected.

## 2. Logical Comparison

- Conditional Logic:
  Both files apply customer-type based discounts (PREMIUM: 20%, STANDARD: 10%).
  Both add an extra 5% discount if amount > 10000.
  Both check for negative final amount and reset to zero if negative.

- Arithmetic Operations:
  Both perform identical arithmetic for discount calculation and subtraction.

- Edge Case Handling:
  Both handle unknown customer types by assigning zero discount.
  Both ensure final amount is never negative.

- Return Behavior:
  Both return the final discounted amount (double in Java, float in Python).
