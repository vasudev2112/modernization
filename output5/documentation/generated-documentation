# Code Documentation

## 1. File Overview

- File Name: discount_calculator.py

- Language: Python

- Location: input/discount_calculator.py

## 2. Imports

_None detected in this file._

## 3. Classes

### Class: DiscountCalculator

#### Methods

- Method Name: calculate_discount

  - Parameters:
    - amount (float): original purchase amount
    - customer_type (str): type of customer ("PREMIUM" or "STANDARD")

  - Return Type: float

  - Description: Calculates the final amount after applying discounts based on customer type and purchase amount. Returns the discounted amount, ensuring it is not negative.

#### Static Methods

- calculate_discount is defined as a static method, mirroring the Java static method.

## 4. Exception Handling

No explicit exception handling is implemented in this file.

## 5. Execution Flow

- The program defines a DiscountCalculator class with a static method calculate_discount.
- The calculate_discount method computes a discount based on customer type and purchase amount, then returns the final amount.
- The main block demonstrates the use of calculate_discount with sample values and prints the results to standard output.

## 6. Observations

- The file does not use any external libraries or imports.
- Discount rates are hardcoded based on customer type and purchase amount.
- The logic ensures that the final discounted amount is not negative.
- The entry point is implemented using if __name__ == "__main__":, mirroring Java's main method.

## 7. Static Analysis Limitations

- Behavior not determinable from static code analysis: The actual runtime input and output, integration with other systems, and usage context cannot be inferred from this file alone.
- No explicit description provided in source code beyond the method docstring and comments.
