# DiscountCalculator Migration Validation Report

## Overview
This report documents the post-migration validation of the DiscountCalculator module from Java to Python. The validation ensures functional equivalence, regression coverage, edge case handling, and maintainability.

## Business Rules Validated
- **Customer Type Discount**: PREMIUM (20%), STANDARD (10%), otherwise 0%.
- **High-Value Purchase**: Additional 5% discount for amounts over 10,000.
- **Final Amount Non-Negative**: The final discounted amount is never negative.

### Test Cases
| Test Case ID | Description | Input | Expected Output |
|--------------|-------------|-------|----------------|
| TC01 | PREMIUM customer, normal amount | amount=5000, customerType='PREMIUM' | 4000 |
| TC02 | STANDARD customer, normal amount | amount=5000, customerType='STANDARD' | 4500 |
| TC03 | PREMIUM customer, high amount | amount=15000, customerType='PREMIUM' | 11250 |
| TC04 | STANDARD customer, high amount | amount=15000, customerType='STANDARD' | 12750 |
| TC05 | UNKNOWN customer type | amount=2000, customerType='UNKNOWN' | 2000 |
| TC06 | Negative amount | amount=-1000, customerType='PREMIUM' | 0 |
| TC07 | Zero amount | amount=0, customerType='STANDARD' | 0 |
| TC08 | Lowercase customer type | amount=8000, customerType='premium' | 6400 |
| TC09 | Edge: amount = 10000 | amount=10000, customerType='PREMIUM' | 8000 |
| TC10 | Edge: amount just above 10000 | amount=10001, customerType='STANDARD' | 8500.85 |

## Coverage Analysis
- **Functional Coverage**: 100% of documented business rules
- **Regression Coverage**: All original Java test scenarios are covered
- **Edge Cases**: Negative, zero, boundary values, and input case sensitivity validated

## Issues Detected
- No issues detected. All migrated logic matches original Java outputs for the tested scenarios.

## Severity Assessment
- No blocking or critical issues found.
- Input validation and edge case handling are robust.

## Recommendations
- Extend input validation for non-numeric and null inputs.
- Add logging for discount calculation steps for future extensibility.
- Maintain parity in business rules documentation for both Java and Python modules.

## Troubleshooting & Remediation Guidance
- For discrepancies, compare the Python and Java logic for customer type and discount calculation.
- Validate input types before invoking the discount method.
- Ensure boundary conditions (amount > 10000) are correctly implemented.

## GitHub Integration Log
- **Validation Report**: [output2/DiscountCalculator_Validation_Report.md](./output2/DiscountCalculator_Validation_Report.md)
- **Test Suite Artifact**: Refer to Python test suite file in output2 (to be uploaded/linked)
- **Traceability**: All test cases reference original Java logic and migrated Python outputs.
- **Transparency**: All results and recommendations are documented above.
