### Class: DiscountCalculator

#### Methods

- Method Name: calculateDiscount
  - Parameters:
    - amount (float): original purchase amount
    - customerType (str): type of customer (PREMIUM or STANDARD)

  - Calls `calculateDiscount` with sample values and prints results to standard output.

## 4. Exception Handling

- No explicit exception handling (try-except) present in the code.

## 5. Execution Flow

- The program defines a class `DiscountCalculator` with a static method.
- The main execution block calls `calculateDiscount` with sample values and prints the results.

## 6. Observations

- All logic is contained within a static method.
- Python type hints are used for method parameters and return type.
- No external libraries or imports are used.
- No explicit description provided in source code comments.

## 7. Static Analysis Limitations

- Business purpose and runtime behavior cannot be determined beyond what is described in code comments and method signatures.
- No information about integration with other systems, frameworks, or persistence.
- Behavior for customer types other than "PREMIUM" or "STANDARD" is not documented.
