### Class: DiscountCalculator

#### Methods

- Method Name: calculate_discount

#### Main Execution Block

- Entry point for sample execution. Prints the result of calculate_discount for three sample inputs.

## 4. Exception Handling

- No explicit exception handling present in the code.

## 5. Execution Flow

- The main block calls DiscountCalculator.calculate_discount with three sets of parameters and prints the results to standard output.

## 6. Observations

- The code handles two customer types: "PREMIUM" and "STANDARD", applying different discount rates.
- An additional discount is applied for purchase amounts greater than 10,000.
- Ensures the final amount cannot be negative.
- For customer types other than "PREMIUM" or "STANDARD", no discount is applied.

## 7. Static Analysis Limitations

- Behavior not determinable from static code analysis for unspecified customer types beyond "PREMIUM" and "STANDARD".
- No information about integration with other systems or frameworks.
- No explicit description provided in source code.
