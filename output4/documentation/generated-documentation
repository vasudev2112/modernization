## 1. File Overview

- File Name: DiscountCalculator.py
- Language: Python
- Location: Not specified (derived from source code)

## 2. Imports

- None

## 3. Classes

### Class: DiscountCalculator

#### Methods

- Method Name: calculate_discount

  - Parameters:
    - amount (float): original purchase amount
    - customer_type (str): type of customer ("PREMIUM" or "STANDARD")
  - Return Type: float (final amount after discount)
  - Description: Calculates the final amount after applying a discount based on customer type and purchase amount. The discount is increased for "PREMIUM" and "STANDARD" customers, and an additional discount is applied for amounts greater than 10,000. The final amount is never negative.

#### Static Methods

- calculate_discount is implemented as a static method, mirroring Java's static method behavior.

## 4. Exception Handling

- No explicit exception handling present in the code.

## 5. Execution Flow

- The main entry point executes three sample calls to calculate_discount with different parameters and prints the resulting amounts.

## 6. Observations

- The class is self-contained and does not depend on any external libraries or custom imports.
- All logic is implemented in a static method.
- The method strictly follows the original Java logic for discount calculation and edge-case handling.

## 7. Static Analysis Limitations

- No explicit description provided in source code.
- Behavior not determinable from static code analysis beyond the visible code structure and documented comments.
