## 1. File Overview

- File Name: Not specified in source code.
- Language: Python
- Location: Not specified in source code.

## 2. Imports

- No import statements present in this file.

## 3. Classes

Class: DiscountCalculator

Methods

Method Name: calculate_discount

  - Parameters:
    - amount (float): original purchase amount
    - customer_type (str): type of customer (PREMIUM or STANDARD)
  - Return Type: float (final amount after discount)
  - Description: Calculates the final amount after applying discounts based on customer type and purchase amount. The method applies a base discount depending on the customer type ("PREMIUM" or "STANDARD") and adds an additional discount if the amount exceeds 10,000. Ensures the final amount is not negative.

Method Name: N/A (main block)

  - Parameters: None (demonstrates usage via direct calls)
  - Return Type: None
  - Description: Entry point of the program. Demonstrates usage of the calculate_discount method with sample values and prints the results to standard output.

## 4. Exception Handling

- No explicit exception handling (try-except blocks) present in the code.

## 5. Execution Flow

- The script, when executed as the main module, makes three sample calls to DiscountCalculator.calculate_discount with different parameters and prints the results.
- The calculate_discount method computes a discount based on customer type and purchase amount, ensures the result is not negative, and returns the final amount.

## 6. Observations

- The code uses string comparison for customer type in a case-insensitive manner.
- No checks for None input values or invalid customer types other than defaulting to zero discount.
- No package declaration or imports are present.
- No explicit description provided in source code except for the method docstring and in-line comments.

## 7. Static Analysis Limitations

- Behavior not determinable from static code analysis: The business context, possible input sources, or integration with external systems are not evident from the code alone.
- No information about how this class is used outside the provided main block.
- No validation for None or malformed input parameters.
- No runtime simulation or external dependencies detected.
