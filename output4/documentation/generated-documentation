- Language: Python
- Location: Not specified (conversion from Java source)

2. Imports

3. Classes

Class: DiscountCalculator

Methods

Method Name: calculate_discount

  - Parameters:
    - amount (float): original purchase amount
    - customer_type (str): type of customer ("PREMIUM" or "STANDARD")
  - Return Type: float (final amount after discount)
  - Description: Calculates the final amount after applying a customer-based and high-value purchase discount to the original amount. Ensures the final amount is not negative.

Method Name: (No explicit method, but includes Python main entry point)

  - Parameters: None (uses direct function calls in main block)
  - Return Type: None
  - Description: Entry point for sample execution. Calls `calculate_discount` with sample values and prints the results.

4. Exception Handling

- No explicit exception handling (try-except blocks) is present in the code.

5. Execution Flow

- The main block executes three sample calls to `calculate_discount` with different parameters and prints the results.
- The `calculate_discount` method applies discounts based on the customer type and purchase amount, then returns the computed value.

6. Observations

- The code contains inline comments and a method-level docstring for `calculate_discount`.
- The discount logic is handled with conditional statements.
- The code ensures the final amount is not negative.
- No external libraries or frameworks are used.

7. Static Analysis Limitations

- No explicit description provided in source code.
- Behavior not determinable from static code analysis: The actual runtime input/output and integration with other systems (e.g., user interfaces, databases) cannot be inferred from this file alone.
